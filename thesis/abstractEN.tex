In molecular dynamics simulations most commonly simplified force fields are used.
They use Coulomb's law for electrostatic forces between atoms. Atoms are assigned with electrostatic force value not accounting for their surrounding.
This helps to make calculations with large atoms count fast, but accuracy is noticebly diminished in cases there electrostatic energies play a bigger role.
Current applications of polarized fields show increased accuracy in inter-molecular interactions models, like water freezing or large molecules (proteins, lipids) folding.
This paper analyses fluctuating charge polarized force field application in molecules clumping models.
